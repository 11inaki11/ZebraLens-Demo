The patient noted that the urticaria began at the age of 12, and did not seem to have any obvious trigger. Each individual lesion would last from 12–24 hours, and the entire episode would last 5–10 days. Lesions would usually start on the chest and then spread over the entire body. She had seen multiple physicians, including allergists and dermatologists, and had been treated with a variety of medications including certirizine, desloratadine, hydroxyzine, montelukast, ranitidine, and diphenhydramine without relief. Prednisone at high doses would provide temporary relief, and she had required multiple courses of prednisone over the past 20 years. In addition, she complained of occasional angioedema, usually at the same time as the hives but occasionally occurring when hives were not present. The patient also had acne that had been very difficult to control since her teenage years, and she noted that the acne would also respond to prednisone.\nMultiple lab tests over the years had been unremarkable. These included SSA/SSB, anti-Smith, ACE level, C3/C4, hepatitis B, ANA, anti double-stranded DNA, immunoglobulins, SPEP, C1 esterase inhibitor level and function, chemistry panel, liver tests, TSH, T4, thyroid antibodies, rheumatoid factor, ESR, and CBC. Skin biopsy of a lesion had been read as \"chronic urticaria\".\nUpon further questioning, it was learned that due to the patient's endometriosis, she had very irregular menstrual cycles in terms of length and timing. It was determined that the hives and/or angioedema would begin approximately 4 days prior to the onset of menses, and would last about 2 days into menses. The symptoms would not occur with every episode of menses. The patient's acne would often occur on her face during the urticarial episodes. Of ",

Her symptoms first appeared in childhood but increased in frequency and severity after menopause. During her reproductive years, she had experienced a myriad of urologic and gynecological symptoms. In her 20s, the preponderance of her symptoms involved her bladder, and she was subsequently diagnosed with interstitial cystitis. In her 30s, her gynecologic symptoms became more prominent and she was ultimately diagnosed with endometriosis for which she underwent a hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy at age 33. Throughout this time, her unexplained episodic vulvar symptoms were present; however, it was not until menopause that her vulvar symptoms became persistent and the frequency and severity of her flares dramatically increased. She found that the application of cold water and minimizing humidity and warmth in the perineal region were the only ameliorative modalities consistently effective in decreasing the frequency and severity of her “flares.” It is interesting to note that her mother and a maternal aunt had similar lifelong symptoms which they had attributed to horse back riding.\nOn initial evaluation, the patient had normal appearing vulvar skin and vulvar mucosal changes consistent with the diagnosis of menopausal atrophy. On examination, she experienced diffuse burning and pain when the vulvar skin was gently stroked with a cotton swab. For the purpose of the symptomatic management of worsening burning and dyspareunia, we prescribed a trial of topical estrogen (0.05%) and lidocaine (5%) compounded in hydrophilic petrolatum. While this regimen provided some relief, she continued to experience “flares.” Consequently, the patient was asked to return upon recurrence of a “flare” for evaluation",

She was enrolled in a clinical trial for the treatment of psoriasis, consisting of weekly subcutaneous abdominal injections of secukinumab. After about a month of this trial, her skin and joint findings almost completely resolved. She also at this time developed light vaginal spotting. Two months later, she developed mild periumbilical pain described as “muscle soreness.” At four months, she noticed mild left upper abdominal distension, dyspepsia, and increasing duration and amount of vaginal bleeding. Her skin and joint psoriatic symptoms also started to recur around this time.

The obstetrical history of the patient consisted of a pregnancy resulting in term cesarean delivery. She presented with cyclic eczematous eruptions starting 1 year after the delivery. The lesions occurred ∼ 6 days before the menses and disappeared in between 1 and 2 days after the menstruation ceased. She reported no episodes of skin lesions during the pregnancy or during the breast-feeding period. The physical examination revealed several erythematous macules and patches on the hand, forearms, and elbows. The patient was evaluated by dermatologists. Allergy testing was performed and the results were negative. The patient reported that she had been submitted to a treatment with antihistamines 2 years previously, but this treatment had not improved her symptoms. The pelvic examination and ultrasound assessment were essentially normal. The routine laboratory investigations, the results of the biochemistry, complete blood count, and the hormone profiling revealed no abnormal findings.\nWe performed an intradermal test using 50 mg/mL progesterone (Progestan, Koçak Farma, Istanbul, Turkey) as a positive control, and normal saline was used as a negative control.

Family history was non-significant for CAD or diabetes, and social history was remarkable for active tobacco smoking. The patient had been having intermittent substernal chest pain for two weeks. On the day of the presentation, she described an episode of acute onset, sub-sternal chest pain lasting for approximately 20 minutes while at her desk job. The pain had subsided gradually over the next 20-30 minutes, was not associated with any dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, upper extremity or neck discomfort, or a headache. The patient drove herself to the hospital and while in the waiting room, she had a return of chest pressure that was similar to the earlier episode. Her chest pain improved greatly with nitroglycerin. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy, with no significant ST or T wave changes (Figure ). Cardiac biomarkers showed normal creatine kinase-muscle/brain (CK-MB) with mild troponin elevation (0.14 ng/ml), which subsequently normalized. Other labs were normal.

One month before the visit, she had been experiencing occasional numbness extending from the left forearm to the outer side of the upper arm. A few days before the visit, she became aware of left-sided chest pain, which developed without any particular trigger, including during rest, and appeared frequently during the day, lasting for less than 1 min. The chest pain extended laterally from the left anterior chest to the lateral chest, was localized to an area larger than the size of the palm and did not extend beyond the midline. She had no history of trauma or heavy lifting.\nThere was no alteration in the pain intensity on deep breathing or changing posture. Moreover, the patient reported no abdominal pain, burping, or heartburn.

After the pain had subsided, the patient was discharged and directed to consult a cardiologist.\nBased on the necrosis marker changes and presence of type-B pain on that day, the cardiologist recommended a stress test, but the patient was unable to meet the physical requirements for accurate evaluation. In the absence of a stress test, an invasive coronary angiography (ICA) was requested. ICA revealed normal coronary arteries, but ventriculography showed an outpouching on the left ventricle that was thought to be an aneurysm ().\nFurther investigation was performed in a 1.5-Tesla MRI scanner (Avanto, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) with a four-element phased-array cardiac coil using perfusion, cine-Steady-state free precession (SSFP) and delayed-enhancement sequences. MRI results confirmed the presence of the pouch, appending to the posterior and lateral wall of the left ventricle (). It measured 5.8 cm in the long-axis view and 2.4 cm in the short axis.\nAs seen in , the pouch was separate from the apex. The wall thickness of the thinner segment of LV2 was 5 mm in end diastole, a little bit less than the remaining left ventricular myocardium.\nThe majority of the pouch was found to be contractile.",

We therefore recommended that patient take conservative treatment measures such as fixed point, quantitative radiotherapy, and anti-osteoporosis drugs.\nThe results of the follow-up were not very satisfactory, and the family members of the patient did not want us to understand the true condition of the patient so that we could not evaluate the final result of the patient.\n\nDemographics: Age: 65.0 year\n\nMetadata: Age: [[65.0, 'year']]",

The patient had undergone radiation therapy of the total body and bone marrow transplantation at age 6. Since the onset of the disease he had been receiving intravenous and oral corticosteroids. Three months post-transplantation, the patient developed lung disease secondary to graft- versus-host disease and received high doses of intravenous and oral steroids. Subsequently, the patient developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia and was treated again with high doses of intravenous and oral steroids.\nPhysical examination revealed a small for his age Cushingoid boy with severe loss of muscle bulk due to steroid-induced myopathy. His height was 47 inches, which lies between the 3rd and 9th centile and his weight was 54.3 lb, which lies between the 24th and 50th centile. Radiographic evaluation of the spine and hips revealed compression fractures in thoracic spine (T11, T12) and mild deformity of the femoral epiphyses (Fig. ).

During the first days the patient was in coma, with Glasgow Coma Scale of 5 points. After slow amelioration of his status he presented with severe dysarthria, dysphagia, as well as bilateral parkinsonism and dystonia of his extremities. The neurological examination showed a bilateral positive Babinski sign, global rigidity in all extremities as well as symmetrical hyperreflexia.

While urinating he sneezed which was accompanied by lancinating perineal pain that was short-lived, and he was able to complete micturition normally. There was no haematuria or urethral bleeding noted. Later that day he developed urgency, urinary frequency (every 2-3 hours), and nocturia (3 episodes/night) and burning and pain on micturition accompanied by fever, chills, rigors, headache, and malaise. Three days later he developed terminal haematuria and sought medical attention.\nWhen seen, he denied having any flu-like symptoms or urethral discharge. He appeared unwell and had a fever of 99.6 Fahrenheit. His mucous membranes were pink and moist and the general physical examination was normal. His pulse rate was 103/minute and BP 130/73 mmHg. The abdominal examination was normal and he had no renal angle or suprapubic tenderness. Examination of the genitalia was normal except for tenderness in the perineum.

In contrast, the retrieved case (ID 167216) involves a 57‑year‑old gentleman who had high‑grade intermittent fever and chills for three months but no urinary symptoms or hematuria; his urine was essentially bland. Both patients share a prolonged febrile illness with chills, yet the user’s case includes hematuria while the retrieved case does not.\n\nDemographically, the ages are similar (52 vs 57 years) and both are male. The retrieved patient had a history of type 2 diabetes and normal blood pressure, whereas no such comorbidities are mentioned for the user’s patient. Outcomes differ markedly: the retrieved case required extensive investigation, renal biopsy, steroid therapy, and eventually mycophenolate mofetil to control fever and improve kidney function, whereas the user’s query does not provide any treatment or outcome information.\n\nThus, while both cases involve persistent fever and chills in middle‑aged men, the presence of hematuria, absence of urinary findings in the retrieved case, and the extensive diagnostic workup and immunosuppressive therapy in ID 167216 set it apart from the user’s more typical presentation of a complicated urinary tract infection.",

        "content": "Title: Renal disease masquerading as pyrexia of unknown origin\n\nPatient: A 57-year-old gentleman was referred with high grade intermittent fever with chills since 3 months. He was a longstanding type 2 diabetic, on oral hypoglycemic agents with a fairly good sugar control. He did not have any constitutional symptoms like weight loss or anorexia. He was normotensive and had no specific urinary symptoms. Other than the fever for which he consumed paracetamol, he was fairly asymptomatic. There were no clinical clues to the etiology for the fever on systemic examination.\nThe complete blood count of the patient showed an Hemoglobin 11 g/dL, total leukocyte count 10,100 (polymorphs 85, lymphocytes 13% and eosinophils 2%) and a normal platelet count of 2.73 lacs. Liver function tests were essentially normal with a bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase/ALT of 36 and 31 IU/L, serum albumin 3.84 g/dL, and serum globulin 2.46 g/dL. Renal function tests showed BUN 55 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, and normal serum electrolytes. The urine analysis was essentially bland with no albumin, 1-2 pus cells, and no red cells.\nTest results during these 3 months revealed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 90 mm at the end of 1 h and two high C-reactive protein levels of 35.8, 24, and 18.5 mg/L (Normal up to 6 mg/L). Complete blood count, urine examination, chest radiology, and 2D Echo performed to investigate the cause of the fever were all normal. Blood and urine cultures were also negative. Serum Ferritin and complement levels were normal. anti-nuclear antibodies and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were negative. angiotensin converting enzyme levels were normal. Tumor marker profile was negative. Enzyme immunoassays for tuberculosis and brucellosis were negative. He was treated empirically with antibiotics during this period with no permanent relief.\nThe abdominal ultrasound was also essentially normal. A whole body computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple l",
